## Easy Housing

Devised a web application that will serve as a platform for students, working professionals, and anybody else looking for a home in any area. Finding an affordable home to live in a new nation or city can be intimidating, especially for students. The situation is exacerbated by the lack of a digital infrastructure that allows people to readily search for homes. We want to make this a more manageable burden for folks.

Our web application will allow property owners to market their properties, and customers in need of a place will review the listings and schedule appointments. In addition, our online application will assist users in searching for services such as meals, laundry, and other necessities. Furthermore, if individuals have room for one or more people, they can advertise for roommates.
